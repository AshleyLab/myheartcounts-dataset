## Notes
- Item from the Exercise Process Mindset battery.
- The user's benchmark list refers to these as "eating-reasons battery (13)" — this appears to be a misnomer. The actual surveys are about physical activity/exercise mindsets, not eating. The `cardio_exercise_process_mindset_measure_survey.json` and `cardio_adequacy_of_activity_mindset_measure_survey.json` together comprise the activity mindset items.
- This item evaluates users' perception of fun/entertainment value in exercising on a 4-point scale (very boring to very fun).
